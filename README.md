# Design & Make Cool Gadgets
## Objectives
Participants will learn digital fabrication technologies such as CAD modelling, 3D Printing &Laser Cutting, Electronics and Embedded Programming, which they can then use to design and make cool gadgets & prototypes.

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
- Perform 2D and 3D Computer Aided Designs using CAD Software
- Explain the principles of Additive and Subtractive Manufacturing
- Operate 3D Printers and customise jobs for 3D Printing
- Operate Laser Cutters and configure jobs for Laser Cutting &engraving
- Design circuits with common electronics components
- Interface an embedded microcontroller board to sensors, motors & displays and program it to achieve a desired outcome
- Design and fabricate a functional prototype using 3D Printer and Laser Cutter, interface and program embedded microcontroller board
